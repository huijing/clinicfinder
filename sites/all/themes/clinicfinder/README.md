Clarus
======

Clarus is a SASS-enabled starter theme based on Susy for building custom responsive Drupal 7 themes. It uses semantic HTML5 elements and SMACSS classes for cleaner markup.

This theme is not meant to be used out of the box. Rather, it serves as a blank slate for projects which require a bespoke theme, thus this starter theme has all theme-able elements stripped of styles and layouts so the themer has a truly blank canvas to work with.

Included with this theme are basic extends and mixins for the following:
- clearfix
- removing all list styles
- centering block elements
- image replacement
- set element invisible on screen but visible for accessibility
- changing placeholder colours
- changing selection styles
- css shape mixins
- breakpoint mixins
- type-scale mixin
